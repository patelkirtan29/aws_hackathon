Generated: 2026-02-11T20:08:57.389147

✅ Recent highlights (min reading, max signal):
1. In the last 30 days, Meta Platforms has focused heavily on artificial intelligence and smart wearables, notably shifting towards AI-powered smart glasses. The company reported strong business performance for 2025 and is advancing personal superintelligence for 2026. Meta's new AI lab delivered its first key AI models internally in January 2026, showing promise for consumer AI trends. The company is also making organizational changes, including layoffs in San Francisco and Menlo Park, shifting investment from the metaverse to wearables. Meta has raised its price target after strong earnings but faces scrutiny over AI investments and regulatory challenges, including a $268 million EU fight related to WhatsApp. Instagram launched a new map feature raising privacy concerns, and Meta is moving to a Community Notes model, ending third-party fact-checking in the US. Meta is also reducing video live stream storage to 30 days to cut costs. Overall, Meta is heavily investing in AI infrastructure and wearable technology while managing regulatory and privacy issues.
2. Meta Software Engineer interviews typically involve several stages: a recruiter screening, a technical phone screen, multiple coding interviews, a system design interview (especially for mid to senior levels), behavioral rounds, and a hiring committee review. The process emphasizes problem-solving skills, data structures, scalability, and collaboration culture.
3. Candidates can expect questions on coding (manipulating strings, arrays, recursion), data structures, object-oriented programming (Java, C++), and system design. Behavioral interviews focus on past experiences, impact, motivation, and cultural fit. The technical interviews are live coding challenges conducted by Meta engineers.
4. The entire process can take from a few weeks up to around 4 months, depending on referral and scheduling. Candidates often prepare using platforms like LeetCode and Meta's candidate portal materials. Interviewers tend to be friendly and conversational, aiming to assess both technical skills and fit.
5. Difficulty is rated moderately high (around 3.3/5), with about 56% of candidates reporting a positive experience. Preparation tips include practicing coding problems under timed conditions, reviewing system design concepts, and being ready to discuss previous projects and experiences in depth.
6. Meta is actively hiring Software Engineers in 2026, including senior and entry-level roles. There are over 160 Software Engineer openings in Seattle alone, with positions spanning infrastructure, iOS, and AI-related projects. Entry-level roles offer salaries ranging from approximately $120,000 to $290,000 annually, with senior roles paying up to around $205,000 or more depending on experience and location. Meta's hiring includes new grad positions and internships, though some internship hiring was paused as of late 2025 due to reaching headcount limits. The company emphasizes growth, learning, and working on cutting-edge AI and connectivity technologies. Meta is ramping up hiring for mid to senior-level roles (E4+), with thousands of openings. Overall, Meta's 2026 Software Engineer hiring is robust, with competitive compensation and opportunities across various teams and locations.
